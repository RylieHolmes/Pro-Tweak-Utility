## üìñ About The Project

I built this project to be a straightforward tweaking utility that doesn't feel like a risky script. The main goal was to ensure every single tweak could be undone. Before applying a change, the tool automatically saves the original setting. If you don't like a tweak, you can simply revert it with one click.

The cool part is that all the tweaks are defined in a simple `tweaks.json` file. This means you can add or modify optimizations yourself without ever needing to touch the application's code.

## ‚ú® Core Features

*   **Apply and Revert Safely:** Every tweak is reversible. The original system setting is backed up before any changes are made.
*   **System Analyzer:** Scans your PC and suggests some common, safe optimizations to improve performance.
*   **Clean, Modern UI:** The interface is built with standard web tech, so it's easy to use and looks good.
*   **Easy to Modify:** All tweaks live in the `tweaks.json` file. Want to add a new registry tweak? Just add a new entry to the JSON.
*   **Lightweight:** It uses `pywebview` to wrap the web UI, keeping the application small and simple.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

*   **Python 3**
*   **PyWebView** (for the GUI wrapper)
*   **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript** (for the user interface)

## üöÄ Getting Started

Here's how to get the tool running on your machine.

### Prerequisites

*   You need Python 3.8 or newer.
*   This is a Windows-only application.

### Installation & Usage

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/RylieHolmes/Pro-Tweak-Utility.git
    ```
2.  **Go to the project folder:**
    ```sh
    cd Pro-Tweak-Utility
    ```
3.  **Install requirements:**
    ```sh
    pip install pywebview
    ```
4.  **Run the app:**
    You have to run it as an Administrator for it to work.
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```

## üìÇ Project Structure

The project is split into two main parts: the Python backend and the web-based frontend.

*   `app.py`: The core Python file. It handles all the logic for applying and reverting tweaks, reading the JSON file, and managing the window itself.
*   `tweaks.json`: This file contains all the tweak definitions. You can edit this to add, remove, or change tweaks.
*   `web/`: This folder holds all the frontend files (`index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`).

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

Here are some ideas for future updates:

*   [ ] Implement the "Game Mode" feature.
*   [ ] Allow users to create and save their own tweak profiles.
*   [ ] Add more tweaks to the default `tweaks.json`.
*   [ ] Create a logging system for better troubleshooting.
